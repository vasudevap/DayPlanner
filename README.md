# DayPlanner Application

## Description

DayPlanner is an application that allows the user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm).  This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

To work with date and time, [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library was used. 

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
